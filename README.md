## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

#### Linux or macOS

1. Get [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf)
2. Install required plugins
    ```bash
    asdf plugin add ruby
    asdf plugin add nodejs
    asdf plugin add yarn
    asdf plugin add postgres
    ```
3. Install tools
   ```bash
   asdf install
   ```
4.  NOTE: You may get an error here saying `role <username> does not exist`. If this happens, try the following:
    ```bash
    psql -U postgres
    CREATE ROLE <username> SUPERUSER;
    ALTER ROLE "<username>" WITH LOGIN;
    ```
#### Windows

Please refer to `.tool-versions` for the exact versions of the required dependencies.

1. Install Ruby with [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/). (Note: you need a Ruby+Devkit installer)
2. Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
3. Install yarn with `npm install -g yarn`

### Installing

After installing the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), you need to

1. Install all dependencies
    ```bash
    bundle install
    yarn install
    ```
2. Start your postgres server by running
    ```bash
    postgres
    ```
3. Create, migrate and seed the database
    ```bash
    rails db:setup
    ```
4. Start your local development server
    ```bash
    rails s
    ```
5. Install and run mailcatcher SMTP server
   ```bash
   gem install thin -v 1.5.1 -- --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"
   gem install mailcatcher
   mailcatcher -bf
   ```

## Development

On your local machine, you'll need to run the following services:
   ```bash
   postgres
   bin/webpacker-dev-server
   rails s
   ```

You can also run the SMTP server with:
   ```bash
   mailcatcher -b
   ```

## Testing

The test suite is setup with the following technologies:
* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
* [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails)
* [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)

Current linters in the application are:
* [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails)
* [ERB Lint](https://github.com/Shopify/erb-lint)

You can run all quality assurance features like so:
```
rubocop
erblint .
rspec
```

## Deployment

You can find [Beloved Projects](https://beloved-projects.herokuapp.com/) on the web. It is deployed to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Below you will find a set of instructions on how to setup the deployment process.

1. Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
2. Create an account for Heroku.
3. Inside the project directory:
    ```
    heroku login
    heroku apps:create beloved-projects
    heroku git:remote -a beloved-projects
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/ruby
    git push heroku master
    ```
4. You will have to create a PostgreSQL database on Heroku manually.
5. Load your schema and migrate your database with the following commands:
    ```
    heroku run rake db:schema:load
    heroku run rake db:migrate
    ```
6. Done. You should check your deployed app's URL under Settings/Domains.
