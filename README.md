## Testing

For testing purposes we're using the followings:
* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
* [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails)
* [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
* [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails)

```bash
bundle install
rails s
```
There are two separate environments on Heroku: a [staging](https://staging.beloved-projects.herokuapp.com) and a [production](https://app.beloved-projects.herokuapp.com) environment. These are a work-in-progress at the moment.
